# Image settings
# --------------
# This file sets non-default settings for specific images.
#
# E.g.
# - file: "duckrabbit.jpg"
#   print-pdf:
#     colorspace: "gray"
#
# Possible values
# - print-PDF colorspace: cmyk | gray
#
# To apply settings to all images at once,
# use "all" instead of a filename.
# E.g.
# - file: "all"
#   print-pdf:
#     colorspace: "gray"

# # Here's concise way to define settings
# # once and reuse them for many images.
# # Use this alias to exclude an image
# # from all pre-processing. To use it,
# # add the following line uncommented
# # after the `file: ""` line:
# # <<: *no-modifications
# no-modifications: &no-modifications
#   print-pdf:
#     modify: no
#   screen-pdf:
#     modify: no
#   web:
#     modify: no
#   epub:
#     modify: no
#   app:
#     modify: no

# # Specify the book whose images you're modifying
# samples:

# # Change the colorspace for one image in one format
# - file: "fradkin-1.jpg"
#   print-pdf:
#     colorspace: "gray"

  # # Change the colorspace for all images in a format
  # - file: "fradkin-1.jpg"
  #   print-pdf:
  #     colorspace: "gray"

  # # Include an entire set of modification settings
  # - file: "fradkin-1.jpg"
  #   <<: *no-modifications

  # # Or exclude only one format from modification
  # - file: "fradkin-1.jpg"
  #   web:
  #     modify: no

  # # Or no-modify for all formats. Best for SVGs,
  # # which are currently the same file in all formats.
  # - file: "4.svg"
  #   modify: no

  # # You can also use 'all' to set an option for all formats.
  # - file: "naples.svg"
  #   all:
  #     modify: no
